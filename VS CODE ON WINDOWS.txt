$ @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('http://repo.pbox.me/files/i.ps1'))" && set PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\pbox



gcc/g++: First you have to add a compiler to your computer
---

1. go to http://pbox.me/packages and find gcc11-64-winlibs
$ pbox install gcc11-64-winlibs

2. add the "C:\Programs\gcc11-64-winlibs\bin" in you environment variable 'path'
This includes the compiler and all the header library 

Note: <bits/stdc++.h> is not a standard library and probably won't work on clang++
